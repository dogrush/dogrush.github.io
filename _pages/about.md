I am a Professor at Beihang University. My research focuses on intelligent computing systems, emerging computer architectures, and ML/AI infrastructure. I lead the Computational Intelligence research group (CI-Lab) in Beihang University. Our group is dedicated to advancing the frontiers of intelligent computing through innovative research and development. We explore a wide range of topics including machine learning systems, large language model (LLM) infrastructure, and systems for embodied intelligence.
